// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out 
// which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number 
// usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, 
// he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, 
// and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, 
// which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
